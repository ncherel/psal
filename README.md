# Patch-Based Stochastic Attention

This repository contains the code associated to the paper Patch-Based Stochastic Attention for Image Editing (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03163)
PSAL is an efficient attention layer for images and features-maps. It is based on an efficient nearest-neighbor search approach, fueled by PatchMatch.

## Installation

PSAL contains CUDA code and can only be run on GPU. PSAL is available as a PyTorch extension. You'll need CUDA with NVCC support and PyTorch.

Once all requirements are met, you can install and test the module:
```
python setup.py install
python test.py
```


## Use

Cross-Attention is implemented in the following manner:

```python
import torch
from psal import PSAttention

q = torch.rand(1, 3, 128, 128)
k = torch.rand(1, 3, 64, 64)
v = torch.rand(1, 3, 64, 64)

attention = PSAttention()

output = attention(q, k, v)

```
